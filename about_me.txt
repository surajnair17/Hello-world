in this assignment we are learning to use Github.
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration in 
software development. It hosts Git repositories, 
enabling developers to manage code changes, coordinate teamwork, 
track issues, and automate testing and deployment. With millions of users, 
it fosters social coding and supports open source projects.
